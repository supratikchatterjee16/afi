Description: # Automatic File Identifier
        
        A simple program written to identify by hook(extensions) or by crook(signatures). Failing to either, implies that the file might be a text file with no signature or extension.
        
        ## Using
        
        There is a signature downloader, which is tailored to download and store information found on [File Signatures](https://filesignatures.net/). This creates a python file named signatures.py, which needs to be in the same folder as the program.
        The program imports this and makes use of it.
